# noisemaker-for-threejs: compatibility report

## 1. Source and authority revisions

Report date: 2026-09-24. Source inspected: [`815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2`](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-threejs/commit/815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2).
Full rendered parity at this SHA: **unverified**. This is not a release approval.
A later documentation-only commit does not change this tested source identity.
Any runtime, package, or authority update requires fresh evidence before this report can qualify it.

Three.js WebGL2 adapter with texture, canvas, and EffectComposer entry points. The declared peer range begins at Three.js 0.160. [Source contract](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-threejs/blob/815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2/README.md).

The vendor fetch uses the published CDN engine. STATUS records successive revisions, but fetched files remain outside the repository.
Current upstream discovery SHA: `c9ee8a049b2b63cd300da67c01ee40baf29dc288`.
Published authority: `1.0.176`, source `c9ee8a049b2b63cd300da67c01ee40baf29dc288`.
[Immutable published manifest](https://shaders.noisedeck.app/1.0.176/effects/manifest.json) contains 210 effect IDs.
Its SHA-256 is `05c4d7b7744837ae90a3bb4c89e5403ff09448a74d9d7e824abb3d719ad3314e`.
These IDs do not define complete parameter, state, input, or platform coverage.

Served kit `0.1.5` records `815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2`. [Source metadata](https://kits.noisedeck.app/threejs/0/deployment-meta.json).
Historical measurements remain bound to their original revisions in [completion gaps](COMPLETION_GAPS.md).

## 2. Host and distribution matrix

| Dimension | Status | Measured scope or limit |
|---|---|---|
| Source-level checks | verified | 51 Node tests passed. The full browser image sweep and installed consumer workflow were not executed. |
| Actual host rendering | unverified | No new complete native or browser workflow qualified by this report. |
| Minimum and current host versions | unverified | Declared requirements are not a tested version matrix. |
| Supported operating systems and backends | unverified | This pass does not establish Windows, Linux, and macOS coverage. |
| Installed package and first useful result | unverified | Complete isolated installation was not qualified for this source. |
| Parameters, external inputs, state, and chains | unverified | Full current-authority combinations remain unmeasured. |
| Invalid input and recovery | unverified | Unit checks do not establish every installed public entry point. |
| Upgrade, removal, and resource cleanup | unverified | Prior defects and missing workflows remain in the gap register. |
| Accessibility of provided controls | unverified | Keyboard, focus, labels, and diagnostics need host observations where applicable. |
| Release readiness | blocked | Full parity, installation, host, and artifact evidence remain incomplete. |

## 3. Parity coverage

Full parity requires complete applicable coverage with no skips or missing cases.
Historical NEAR, CHAOS, and tolerated differences do not count as strict equality.
The existing numerical contracts remain separate from exact comparison. This report does not change tolerances or goldens.
Unknown values mean `not measured`, never zero.

| Gate | Expected cases | Executed | Strict passes | Failures | Skips | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current full render suite | not measured | not measured | not measured | not measured | not measured | unverified |

The served compatibility manifest declares mode `all`. That declaration covers the authority catalog but does not prove behavior.
No missing ID conclusion follows without reconciling fixture behavior and the source contract.
Missing effects remain visible toward the full-parity goal. Contract exclusions do not become successful tests.

## 4. Evidence

[Bounded test evidence](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents/threejs-tests.json). [Exact-source Actions](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-threejs/actions?query=head_sha%3A815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2).
[This run evidence](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents) retains commands, exit codes, source identities, and distribution metadata.
Official ecosystem reference: [Current Three.js manual, accessed 2026-09-24](https://threejs.org/manual/en/installation.html).
Source CI, export dispatch, artifact delivery, and rendered parity are separate evidence dimensions.
A successful dispatch or unit-test summary does not establish a full rendered gate.

## 5. Open compatibility limits

See [GAP-001 and the complete gap register](COMPLETION_GAPS.md#4-known-gaps) for evidence, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

1. Reconcile the current authority and complete case inventory, including parameters, inputs, stateful frames, and host versions.
2. Run the existing actual-renderer suite without skip options. Record every missing, failed, refused, or timed-out case.
3. Verify installation, useful output, errors, recovery, upgrades, and removal with the actual distribution.
4. Inspect exact-source CI and retain artifact hashes. Keep unresolved qualification failed or unverified.

All eligible ports have equal priority. Full parity and zero skipped cases remain the goal.
Implementation corrections remain with the separate job. This report does not advance the parity checkpoint.

## 6. History

| Date | Source | Result | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-24 | `815d35fb3365d66a078f0eee155b14709e9ae9f2` | Full qualification unverified | Created the requested maintained compatibility report. Preserved historical evidence and open gaps. |

Run: `20260924-remaining-gap-documents`. Later audits and reviews update this report with source-bound results.
