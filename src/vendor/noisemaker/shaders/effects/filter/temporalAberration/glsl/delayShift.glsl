/*
 * Temporal Chromatic Aberration - shift pass (one stage of the delay line).
 *
 * Copies the source stage into the destination stage, advancing the bucket-brigade shift
 * register by one frame. Alpha is preserved unchanged so the "filled" frontier (alpha 1
 * from the live input vs. alpha 0 from never-written stages) propagates exactly one stage
 * per frame, which the read pass uses for its ramp-in fallback.
